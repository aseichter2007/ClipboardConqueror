Settings Conqueror is a webserver to host a settings app that allows users to change their settings. It is a part of the [Clipboard Conqueror](https://github.com/aseichter2007/ClipboardConqueror) project.

Settings conqueror is currently researching solutions for inserting user defined functions for bot calling, and waiting for finalization of the parent project settings formats which have been rapidly changing.
