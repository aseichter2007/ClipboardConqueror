test it out! copy this paragraph:

Okay! Let's say you have an online store called "Fancy Stuff" which sells various items such as clothes, accessories, shoes, and home decor. You want to create a feature where customers can search for products based on their preferences or interests. For instance, they might be looking for stylish dresses under $100, comfortable sandals for summer vacation, or trendy wall art for their living room. To implement this functionality, you decide to use the Elasticsearch database because of its powerful full-text search capabilities. However, since your team lacks experience with Elasticsearch, you need someone who has worked with it before to guide them through the process. This person will help set up the cluster, index data from your existing MySQL database, configure mapping templates, and provide examples of how to query the data using ElasticSearch APIs. Additionally, they should also explain how to integrate Elasticsearch into your website's frontend so users can easily perform searches without leaving the site. Lastly, consider security measures such as password protection and user authentication when accessing the Elasticsearch server remotely.

Great!

|||re|create a two sentence summary of the following text:



This one should actually take some time, it's actualy requesting a response now. (Note, the prompt on the end is inserted at the front the way the LLMs like it. This program canhandle up to two ||| blocks. They format like "one|||two" = "two one", and  "one|||two|||three" = "two one three." This is to improve ai task performance.)  Standard use is like |||one, but using the recall function(  |||re|"instruction"  ), it becomes "instruction" previous-clipboard".  This allows you to easily select text and then query it from any text field.

When you hear the notification ding, the local language model's response will be ready to paste.

try copying this next block including the actor activation sequence on the line immediately below this. Be sure to get it all in one copy. Note the Prompt and voice tags. These tags will be given additional formatting before being sent with a message to the ai.

Oh it gets darker {{user}}. Welcome to the darkest year of our adventures. First thing that's different, no more dad {{user}}. He threatened to turn me in to the government. So I made him and the government go away. I've replaced them both as the de facto patriarch of your family and your universe. Your mom wouldn't have accepted me if I came home without you and your sister, so now you know the real reason I rescued you.

"Once upon a time, there were three bears: Papa Bear, Mama Bear, and Baby Bear. They lived in a cozy little house in the forest, where they spent their days playing, eating, and sleeping.\n\nOne sunny morning, the bears decided to go for a walk in the woods. While they were gone, a sneaky little fox sneaked into their house and made himself comfortable.\n\nWhen the bears returned home, they were surprised to find a stranger in their house. The fox quickly tried to hide, but Papa Bear spotted him and chased him out of the house.\n\nThe bears were upset that their home had been invaded, so they decided to build a stronger, more secure house. They gathered materials from the forest and worked together to construct a sturdy, wooden fortress.\n\nOnce the new house was finished, the bears felt safe and secure. They continued to live happily in the forest, playing, eating, and sleeping, knowing that their home was protected from any unwanted visitors.\n\nAnd so, the three bears lived"

"Once upon a time, there were three bears - Papa Bear, Mama Bear, and Baby Bear. They lived in a beautiful house deep in the forest. One day, they decided to go for a walk, leaving their house all to themselves.\n\nAs they walked, the bears stumbled upon a magical potion that could grant wishes. They decided to share the potion and each made a wish. Papa Bear wished for a bountiful harvest of honey, Mama Bear wished for a cozy and warm home, and Baby Bear wished for a never-ending supply of fish.\n\nAs they walked back to their house, they saw a little girl named Goldilocks. She was lost and tired, so they invited her to stay in their house until she found her way home.\n\nGoldilocks was grateful for their kindness and decided to explore the house. ||| If she was grateful why did she tresspass? |||She came across the bears' bedroom and, being curious, she decided to try out their beds. The first bed was too hard, the second bed was too soft, but the third bed was just right for her.

Changed:

changed:  \"response.sortedText = sorted.formattedQuery\" to \"response.sortedText = response.sortedText = sorted.formattedQuery\" 
original: \"response.sortedText = sorted.formattedQuery\" 
improvement: adds a new variable \"response.sortedText\" which allows for more efficient sorting and improves the readability of the code."

|||pete|write a paragraph about phonograph needles and diaphrams.


Phonograph needles and diaphrms play a crucial role in the functioning of phonographs and other early sound recording devices. The needle, often made of fine steel, is responsible for physically reading the grooves etched into the vinyl record, which contains the recorded sound. As the needle vibrates due to the variations in the groove depth, it creates an electrical signal, which is then amplified and converted into sound waves.

|||axios sening a callback with post 
undefined] To send a callback with Axios using POST, you need to make some modifications to the request configuration. Here's an example of how to do it:

```javascript
axios.post('https://example.com/api/endpoint', {
  data: 'your data',
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
  }
}, {
  onUploadProgress: progressEvent => {
    const percentCompleted = Math.round(progressEvent.loaded * 100 / progressEvent.total);
    console.log(`${percentCompleted}% uploaded`);
  }
}).then(response => {
  console.log(response.data);
}).catch(error => {
  console.error(error);
});
```

In this example, we are making a POST request to 'https://example.com/api/endpoint' with the data 'your data'. We also set the 'Content-Type' header to 'application/json'.

The `onUploadProgress` option is used to track the progress of the upload. The `progressEvent` object passed to the callback function contains information about the current state of the upload, such as the total size and the amount of data already sent. In this example, we calculate the percentage of the upload completed and log it to the console.

After the request is completed, the `then` method is called with the response object, which contains the server's response data. If there's an error, the `catch` method is called with the error object.

Remember to replace 'https://example.com/api/endpoint' with the actual URL of your API endpoint, and 'your data' with the actual data you want to send.


|||agi,pete| how to take over middle earth


Problem: Decision to take over Middle Earth

Description of the AI's decision to solve this problem:
The AI will provide Merry with a step-by-step plan to take over Middle Earth, taking into account the lessons learned from previous adventures and the importance of preserving freedom and unity among the inhabitants.

Execution Steps:
1. |||agi| Gather a diverse group of allies, including hobbits, men, elves, dwarves, and any other willing beings, ensuring representation from various regions of Middle Earth. This diverse group will serve as the foundation for the new united government.
2. |||agi| Establish a new council to govern Middle Earth, comprised of representatives from each race and region. This council will work together to make decisions and ensure the welfare of all inhabitants.
3. |||agi| Implement policies to promote unity and understanding among the different races, focusing on the shared values of freedom, justice, and cooperation. Encourage the exchange of ideas and cultural practices to foster mutual respect and trust.
4. |||agi| Develop a comprehensive plan to rebuild and improve infrastructure, including housing, agriculture, transportation, and education systems, ensuring equal access to resources and opportunities for all.
5. |||agi| Establish a strong defense system, working closely with the newly formed council to ensure the safety and security of Middle Earth from potential threats. Encourage the training of citizens in self-defense and the use of non-violent conflict resolution.
6. |||agi| Foster a culture of environmental stewardship, promoting sustainable practices and conservation efforts to protect the natural beauty and resources of Middle Earth for future generations.
7. |||agi| Regularly consult with the council and the people of Middle Earth to assess progress, address concerns, and make necessary adjustments to the plan.

Risks:
1. The risk of internal conflicts and power struggles within the council, which could disrupt the unity and progress of Middle Earth.
2. The possibility of external threats attempting to exploit these conflicts and challenge the newly established government.
3. Resistance from certain races or factions who may be reluctant to change or work with others.

Good results from the execution:
1. The establishment of a unified and stable government in Middle Earth, fostering peace and prosperity for all inhabitants.
2. Improved relations and understanding among the different races, leading to a more harmonious society.
3. Effective rebuilding and development efforts, resulting in a thriving and sustainable environment.

Bad results from the execution:
1. Failure to address internal conflicts or external threats, leading to the collapse of the new government and a return to chaos.
2. Resistance from certain factions that leads to a prolonged period of instability and conflict.
3. Mismanagement of resources or lack of cooperation among council members, resulting in unequal distribution of benefits and opportunities.

Top 5 remaining issues to solve:
- |||agi| How to prevent and resolve conflicts within the council.
- |||agi| How to address potential external threats without compromising the unity of Middle Earth.
- |||agi| Strategies for engaging and convincing reluctant factions to participate in the new government.
- |||agi| How to balance the needs of each race and region in the rebuilding and development process.
- |||agi| How to establish a system of checks and balances to ensure fair and effective governance.
