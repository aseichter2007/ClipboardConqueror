That first one is scripted. You can create your own saved memory and retrieveit later on.



test it out! copy this paragraph:

Okay! Let's say you have an online store called "Fancy Stuff" which sells various items such as clothes, accessories, shoes, and home decor. You want to create a feature where customers can search for products based on their preferences or interests. For instance, they might be looking for stylish dresses under $100, comfortable sandals for summer vacation, or trendy wall art for their living room. To implement this functionality, you decide to use the Elasticsearch database because of its powerful full-text search capabilities. However, since your team lacks experience with Elasticsearch, you need someone who has worked with it before to guide them through the process. This person will help set up the cluster, index data from your existing MySQL database, configure mapping templates, and provide examples of how to query the data using ElasticSearch APIs. Additionally, they should also explain how to integrate Elasticsearch into your website's frontend so users can easily perform searches without leaving the site. Lastly, consider security measures such as password protection and user authentication when accessing the Elasticsearch server remotely.

Great!

This one should actually take some time, it's actualy requesting a response now. (Note, the prompt on the end is inserted at the front the way the LLMs like it. This program canhandle up to two ||| blocks. They format like "one|||two" = "two one", and  "one|||two|||three" = "two one three." This is to improve ai task performance.)  Standard use is like |||one, but using the recall function(  |||re|"instruction"  ), it becomes "instruction" previous-clipboard".  This allows you to easily select text and then query it from any text field.

When you hear the notification ding, the local language model's response will be ready to paste.

|||dark| write a standup comedy routine about a cantalope
 Well, at least you know where they got that from.

Ladies and gentlemen, I present to you the fruit that changed my life - the cantaloupe! No, not the band, the actual fruit. It's a melon, but not the kind you find in a fancy restaurant. This is the fruit of the people, the fruit of the streets.

You know what's funny about cantaloupes? They're not actually from Cantaloupe, France. That's right, it's a huge conspiracy. I mean, they should rename it to "Melon de Fraude." But, you know, we can't trust anything from France these days, am I right?

Now, I know what you're thinking, "Why would anyone joke about a cantaloupe?" Well, I'll tell you why. It's because cantaloupes are serious business. You think I'm kidding? Look at this thing - it's like a mini bowling ball with hair! And the rind, oh, the rind! It's like trying to cut through a mini dinosaur's shell.

And don't even get me started on the seeds. They're like landmines, waiting to ruin your day. One minute you're enjoying a juicy, sweet slice of cantaloupe, and the next you're spitting out a seed like a tiny, furry projectile. It's like a fruit version of "American Gladiators."

But let's not forget about the cantaloupe's cousin, the watermelon. It's like the cool, confident brother who gets all the attention. While the cantaloupe is over here, trying to impress with its bumpy exterior and its "I'm so healthy" attitude. But, you know what? The cantaloupe has something the watermelon will never have - a great joke about its own name. And that, my friends, is something you can't put a price on.

So, next time you're at the grocery store, and you see that little cantaloupe hiding in the corner, give it a second glance. Who knows, maybe it'll become your new favorite fruit, or at least provide you with a good laugh. Because, let's face it, we all need a little more humor in our lives, and who better to deliver it than the cantaloupe?
