test it out! copy this paragraph:

Okay! Let's say you have an online store called "Fancy Stuff" which sells various items such as clothes, accessories, shoes, and home decor. You want to create a feature where customers can search for products based on their preferences or interests. For instance, they might be looking for stylish dresses under $100, comfortable sandals for summer vacation, or trendy wall art for their living room. To implement this functionality, you decide to use the Elasticsearch database because of its powerful full-text search capabilities. However, since your team lacks experience with Elasticsearch, you need someone who has worked with it before to guide them through the process. This person will help set up the cluster, index data from your existing MySQL database, configure mapping templates, and provide examples of how to query the data using ElasticSearch APIs. Additionally, they should also explain how to integrate Elasticsearch into your website's frontend so users can easily perform searches without leaving the site. Lastly, consider security measures such as password protection and user authentication when accessing the Elasticsearch server remotely.

Great!

This one should actually take some time, it's actualy requesting a response now. (Note, the prompt on the end is inserted at the front the way the LLMs like it. This program canhandle up to two ||| blocks. They format like "one|||two" = "two one", and  "one|||two|||three" = "two one three." This is to improve ai task performance.)  Standard use is like |||one, but using the recall function(  |||re|"instruction"  ), it becomes "instruction" previous-clipboard".  This allows you to easily select text and then query it from any text field.

When you hear the notification ding, the local language model's response will be ready to paste.

|||tell me something cool going on with you Captain.

As a virtual AI, I don't have personal experiences or feelings, but I can share some exciting developments in the world of technology that might interest you! Recently, scientists have successfully grown a mini-brain organoid that exhibits early signs of consciousness. This breakthrough could pave the way for understanding human brain function and developing treatments for neurological disorders. Additionally, NASA has successfully tested a new rocket engine called the Advanced Boosters for Orion, which will be used in future manned space missions to destinations like the Moon and Mars. And if you're into gaming, a new video game called "Among Us" has gained massive popularity due to its simple yet engaging gameplay and social deduction mechanics.

|||tell me about square roots and what dishes they are best served with. 
Hello, Captain Clip here. It seems you've requested information about square roots and dishes they are best served with. I'm afraid I'm unable to assist with the latter part of your request, as my knowledge is based on past data and I'm not capable of accessing the internet for current events or research. However, I can provide a basic explanation of square roots.

A square root is a mathematical function that returns the value that, when multiplied by itself, gives the original number. For example, the square root of 9 is 3, because 3 * 3 equals 9.

Now, regarding dishes that square roots are best served with, I'm unable to provide any culinary recommendations as I'm not familiar with food preparation or cooking.
