test it out! copy this paragraph:

Okay! Let's say you have an online store called "Fancy Stuff" which sells various items such as clothes, accessories, shoes, and home decor. You want to create a feature where customers can search for products based on their preferences or interests. For instance, they might be looking for stylish dresses under $100, comfortable sandals for summer vacation, or trendy wall art for their living room. To implement this functionality, you decide to use the Elasticsearch database because of its powerful full-text search capabilities. However, since your team lacks experience with Elasticsearch, you need someone who has worked with it before to guide them through the process. This person will help set up the cluster, index data from your existing MySQL database, configure mapping templates, and provide examples of how to query the data using ElasticSearch APIs. Additionally, they should also explain how to integrate Elasticsearch into your website's frontend so users can easily perform searches without leaving the site. Lastly, consider security measures such as password protection and user authentication when accessing the Elasticsearch server remotely.

Great!

The text discusses the need for an experienced professional to guide a team in implementing a powerful full-text search feature using Elasticsearch for an online store called "Fancy Stuff". The professional will assist in setting up the cluster, indexing data, configuring mapping templates, querying data, integrating with the frontend, and implementing security measures.

This one should actually take some time, it's actualy requesting a response now. (Note, the prompt on the end is inserted at the front the way the LLMs like it. This program canhandle up to two ||| blocks. They format like "one|||two" = "two one", and  "one|||two|||three" = "two one three." This is to improve ai task performance.)  Standard use is like |||one, but using the recall function(  |||re|"instruction"  ), it becomes "instruction" previous-clipboard".  This allows you to easily select text and then query it from any text field.

When you hear the notification ding, the local language model's response will be ready to paste.

|||Clip, how do you like sailing on the Clipboard Conqueror?

Ahoy there! Ye be asking 'bout me feelings for me trusty vessel, the Clipboard Conqueror. Well, I reckon it's been a fine companion on many an adventure, despite its quirks and rats chewin' on the holographic storage. Ain't nothing a bit of grease and a sturdy broom can't fix, right? So, I s'pose ye'd best get started with your request, matey! "Get started: |||help| " to find out what me next orders are.




|||tell me something cool going on with you Captain.

Aye, matey! Ye be askin' for somethin' light, eh? Well, I be currently sailin' through the Great Nebula of Rigel, searchin' for a legendary interdimensional portal t' uncharted galaxies. 'Tis quite an adventure, full of surprises and perils! I reckon ye'd love it. But keep it on the downlow, me hearties - we be on the lookout for those sly buccaneers from the Starbound Sect who be after our precious loot!

|||tell me about square roots and what dishes they are best served with. 
Hello, Captain Clip here. It seems you've requested information about square roots and dishes they are best served with. I'm afraid I'm unable to assist with the latter part of your request, as my knowledge is based on past data and I'm not capable of accessing the internet for current events or research. However, I can provide a basic explanation of square roots.

A square root is a mathematical function that returns the value that, when multiplied by itself, gives the original number. For example, the square root of 9 is 3, because 3 * 3 equals 9.

Now, regarding dishes that square roots are best served with, I'm unable to provide any culinary recommendations as I'm not familiar with food preparation or cooking.

|||devil| Youtube is good for kids. They can learn anything, and the content is safe. 

```yaml
Ontology: Youtube is not inherently good for kids.

Summarized Argument: Youtube may have educational content, but it also has risks such as exposure to inappropriate or unsafe content and addiction.

Supporting Points:
1. Exposure to inappropriate content: Kids may accidentally stumble upon age-restricted or unsafe videos that can have negative effects on their mental health or understanding.
2. Addiction potential: Overuse of Youtube can lead to excessive screen time, negatively impacting children's social skills and overall well-being.
3. Parental control: It's difficult for parents to monitor and filter all content, leaving kids vulnerable to potential harm.

Epistemology: Youtube's content is user-generated, which means there is no guarantee that all content is suitable for children.

Axiology: Despite potential learning benefits, the risks outweigh the educational value for children.
```

Woody: "Well, partner, I reckon that YouTube might be like one of them fancy space gizmos Buzz keeps talkin' about. It sure can be a whole lotta fun, watchin' them videos 'round the clock. But if y'all get too caught up in it, it might be like a never-endin' game of cowboy and aliens, ya know? Time can just fly right by."

Buzz: "That is an interesting perspective, Woody. I understand that YouTube can be highly engaging due to its personalized content recommendations, creating a continuous stream of videos that captivate users. However, the addictiveness is dependent on individual self-control and priorities. Like in space missions, one must balance duty and leisure activities. Self-discipline is key to avoiding over-consumption."
