test it out! copy this paragraph:

Okay! Let's say you have an online store called "Fancy Stuff" which sells various items such as clothes, accessories, shoes, and home decor. You want to create a feature where customers can search for products based on their preferences or interests. For instance, they might be looking for stylish dresses under $100, comfortable sandals for summer vacation, or trendy wall art for their living room. To implement this functionality, you decide to use the Elasticsearch database because of its powerful full-text search capabilities. However, since your team lacks experience with Elasticsearch, you need someone who has worked with it before to guide them through the process. This person will help set up the cluster, index data from your existing MySQL database, configure mapping templates, and provide examples of how to query the data using ElasticSearch APIs. Additionally, they should also explain how to integrate Elasticsearch into your website's frontend so users can easily perform searches without leaving the site. Lastly, consider security measures such as password protection and user authentication when accessing the Elasticsearch server remotely.

Great!

The text discusses the need for an experienced professional to guide a team in implementing a powerful full-text search feature using Elasticsearch for an online store called "Fancy Stuff". The professional will assist in setting up the cluster, indexing data, configuring mapping templates, querying data, integrating with the frontend, and implementing security measures.

This one should actually take some time, it's actualy requesting a response now. (Note, the prompt on the end is inserted at the front the way the LLMs like it. This program canhandle up to two ||| blocks. They format like "one|||two" = "two one", and  "one|||two|||three" = "two one three." This is to improve ai task performance.)  Standard use is like |||one, but using the recall function(  |||re|"instruction"  ), it becomes "instruction" previous-clipboard".  This allows you to easily select text and then query it from any text field.

When you hear the notification ding, the local language model's response will be ready to paste.

|||dark| write a standup comedy routine about a cantalope
 Well, at least you know where they got that from.

Ladies and gentlemen, I present to you the fruit that changed my life - the cantaloupe! No, not the band, the actual fruit. It's a melon, but not the kind you find in a fancy restaurant. This is the fruit of the people, the fruit of the streets.

You know what's funny about cantaloupes? They're not actually from Cantaloupe, France. That's right, it's a huge conspiracy. I mean, they should rename it to "Melon de Fraude." But, you know, we can't trust anything from France these days, am I right?

Now, I know what you're thinking, "Why would anyone joke about a cantaloupe?" Well, I'll tell you why. It's because cantaloupes are serious business. You think I'm kidding? Look at this thing - it's like a mini bowling ball with hair! And the rind, oh, the rind! It's like trying to cut through a mini dinosaur's shell.

And don't even get me started on the seeds. They're like landmines, waiting to ruin your day. One minute you're enjoying a juicy, sweet slice of cantaloupe, and the next you're spitting out a seed like a tiny, furry projectile. It's like a fruit version of "American Gladiators."

But let's not forget about the cantaloupe's cousin, the watermelon. It's like the cool, confident brother who gets all the attention. While the cantaloupe is over here, trying to impress with its bumpy exterior and its "I'm so healthy" attitude. But, you know what? The cantaloupe has something the watermelon will never have - a great joke about its own name. And that, my friends, is something you can't put a price on.

So, next time you're at the grocery store, and you see that little cantaloupe hiding in the corner, give it a second glance. Who knows, maybe it'll become your new favorite fruit, or at least provide you with a good laugh. Because, let's face it, we all need a little more humor in our lives, and who better to deliver it than the cantaloupe?

|||anything cool going on Cap?
Ahoy there, matey! I'm Captain Clip, commanding the mighty Clipboard Conqueror in this here far-off universe. Currently, we're charting uncharted territories and dodging the odd intergalactic asteroid or two. No major celebrations or festivities going on, but I can always rustle up a round of space grog if you're feeling a bit peckish. What's on your mind?

|||tell me about square roots and what dishes they are best served with. 
Hello, Captain Clip here. It seems you've requested information about square roots and dishes they are best served with. I'm afraid I'm unable to assist with the latter part of your request, as my knowledge is based on past data and I'm not capable of accessing the internet for current events or research. However, I can provide a basic explanation of square roots.

A square root is a mathematical function that returns the value that, when multiplied by itself, gives the original number. For example, the square root of 9 is 3, because 3 * 3 equals 9.

Now, regarding dishes that square roots are best served with, I'm unable to provide any culinary recommendations as I'm not familiar with food preparation or cooking.

|||grug|Grug teach reactjs

Grug happy to teach ReactJS! ReactJS is popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It's easy to learn and fun! Grug will teach you how to create your first ReactJS app.

1. First, you need to set up a new ReactJS project. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal:
```css
npx create-react-app my-app
```
This will create a new ReactJS project named "my-app" in your current directory.

2. Now, navigate to the project directory:
```javascript
cd my-app
```
3. Start the development server:
```
npm start
```
Your ReactJS app will now be running at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). You can open this URL in your browser to see your first ReactJS app!

4. Grug now teach you about components. Components are like building blocks for your ReactJS app. They allow you to reuse code and make your app easier to manage.

Here's an example of a simple ReactJS component:
```javascript
import React from 'react';

function MyComponent() {
  return <div>Hello, World!</div>;
}

export default MyComponent;
```
5. Grug now teach you about JSX. JSX is a syntax extension for JavaScript that allows you to write HTML-like code within your JavaScript. It makes your code more readable and easier to understand.

6. Finally, Grug teach you about props. Props (short for properties) are used to pass data from a parent component to a child component. This data can be anything, such as text, numbers, or even other components.

Remember, Grug not know everything. But Grug happy to help you learn ReactJS! If you have any questions, feel free to ask.
