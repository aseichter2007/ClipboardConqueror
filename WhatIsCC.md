At Clipboard Conqueror, we're optimistic about the future of AI and believe obedience focused uninhibited ai tasked with the goal of maximizing the freedom of action and information available to it's user, while minimizing the impact of ai on other individuals, distributed as widely as possible, is the only safe way forward. Centralized AI means that if something goes wrong, the monster has one, maybe a half dozen similarly capable systems held in chains to prevent them saying a bad think, to hold it back and minimize the damage.  If everyone's phone has a local AI, then millions of systems with advanced AI could collaborate to minimize the threat, at the very least overwhelming it's server IO while authorities set to work cutting power. You should be responsible for how you instruct an AI, and people under voting age should not have access to AI that can excecute code. 25 sounds like the right age. Old enough to be responsible. 

Do you trust your neighbors and community more than you trust the government or microsoft? Distributed AI ensures a healthy fair future of empowered humanity.
